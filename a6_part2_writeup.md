## Question 1: Feature Importance

Based on your house price model, rank the four features from most important to least important. Explain how you determined this ranking.

**YOUR ANSWER:**
1. Most Important: Square feet
2. bedrooms
3. bathrooms
4. Least Important: Age

**Explanation: I determined which feature is most important to least important by the plots on the graph when price was being compared. Square feet being compared to price was linear and had shown the most in variation. As we continued this with bedrooms vs price, bathrooms vs price, and age vs price, the variation lessened as well as how linear the line was.

## Question 2: Interpreting Coefficients

Choose TWO features from your model and explain what their coefficients mean in plain English. For example: "Each additional bedroom increases the price by $___"

**Feature 1: Each additional bedroom increases the total price


**Feature 2: As there is more square feet room, there is more space to create bedrooms

## Question 3: Model Performance

What was your model's R² score? What does this tell you about how well your model predicts house prices? Is there room for improvement?

**YOUR ANSWER: My models R^2 score was 0.12. Yes, there is room for improvement. This is because there is only a 12% variation between different including the prices for houses.

## Question 4: Adding Features

If you could add TWO more features to improve your house price predictions, what would they be and why?

**Feature 1: Location


**Why it would help: The houses vary on price depending on the neighborhood. Different neighborhoods have an average of different amounts of income whcih can affect the price of a house that people in the area can afford.


**Feature 2: Material of house


**Why it would help: The material of the house impacts the total price. This is because the change in stability of the house structure can change with the material its made with, along with the price.

## Question 5: Model Trust

Would you trust this model to predict the price of a house with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 3000 sq ft, and 5 years old? Why or why not? (Hint: Think about the range of your training data)

**YOUR ANSWER: I would not trust this model to predict the price of a house with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 3000 sq ft, and 5 years old. I would not trust this because even though the age range and the bedroom range matches with our graph, the amount of square feet does not. Also, the amount of square feet is the most important part to our data, so if we dont have factual evidence it could be completely oppisite of what we think.
